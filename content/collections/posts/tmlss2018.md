Bitdefender's Machine Learning Unit participated with six of its members at the first edition of the Transylvania Machine Learning Summer School that took place at the end of July 2018 in Cluj-Napoca.

The organizers are important DeepMind figures (and also romanians :D): Doina Precup, Razvan Pascanu and Viorica Patraucean and RIST institute from Cluj (Luigi Malago and Razvan Florian).

The motivation of the Summer School is to help the local community and to better connect the Machine Learning research environment from Eastern Europe with the rest of the world, through encouraging collaborations between students and researchers from Eastern Europe with other more developed research centers and also by offering low fees and great speakers for the school attendees.

Since the school had excellent lecturers, the competition was tough. From over 800 participants, only 100 were selected to participate and to present a poster with his/hers research results or work in progress. The diversity of the participants was an important keypoint in the selection, roughly half of the participants were romanians.

The setup was the following: In each day we had a several lectures (from introductory to more advanced ones) and at the end of the day we had lab sessions (Math, Computer Vision, Language, Generative Models, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning). At the poster sessions, each of us had up to 4h30 to present the poster to anyone interested of if from the school. A detailed program can be found here tmlss.ro/programme.php.

Even though there were 6 full and exhausting days, our team really enjoyed it and tried to get the most out of the lecturers and from the interactions with the participants and the lecturers (mainly DeepMind researchers). Bitdefender was very well represented (8 of us were there) and we come home inspired and eager to continue our research. More, we also get a Best Poster award for Computer Vision (yey!).

It was only the first edition, but every detail was at a very high standard. In the last days, we presented with Traian Rebedea the advantages of having the next Summer School edition here in Bucharest. Looking forward to TMLSS2019 :)
