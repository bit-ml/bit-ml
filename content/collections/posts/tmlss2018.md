**Bitdefender's Machine Learning Unit** participated with eight of its members
at the first edition of the [Transylvania Machine Learning Summer
School](https://tmlss.ro/) that took place at the end of July 2018 in
Cluj-Napoca.

The organizers are well known DeepMind figures (and also Romanians :D), Doina
Precup, Razvan Pascanu and Viorica Patraucean and RIST institute from Cluj -
Luigi Malago and Razvan Florian.

The motivation for the Summer School was to facilitate new relations between
the Machine Learning research community of Eastern Europe with the rest of
the world by encouraging collaboration between students and researchers
from Eastern Europe with other more developed research centers and also by
offering more accessible fees to the school attendees.

Since the school had excellent lecturers, the competition was tough. From over
800 participants, only 100 were selected to participate and to present a poster
with his/hers research results or work in progress. The diversity of the
participants was a keypoint in the selection, roughly half of the
participants were Romanians.

Some words about the schedule. Each day we attended to several lectures, some
of them introductory, other more advanced. At the end of the day we had lab
sessions on Math, Computer Vision, Language, Generative Models, Unsupervised
Learning and Reinforcement Learning. At the poster sessions, each of us had up
to 4h30 to present the poster to anyone interested walking by. A detailed
program can be found here tmlss.ro/programme.php.

Even though there were six full and exhausting days, our team really enjoyed it
and tried to get the most out of the lecturers and from the interactions with
the participants and the lecturers. Bitdefender was very well represented and
we came back home inspired and eager to continue our research.  More, we also
got a Best Poster award for Computer Vision (yey!).

Actually our team enjoyed this experience so much that some of them decided to
give an individual account of some of the highlights of TMLSS2018 and the
lectures that gave them a long lasting impression.


**Tudor Berariu**:

_The Transylvanian Machine Learning Summer School represents the perfect venue
for all who are interested in pursuing a research career in machine learning.
For those that are yet unfamiliar with the field TMLLSS gives the chance to
grasp the fundamental theory of a broad set of core topics. At the same time,
the more experienced participants are being offered a glimpse of the top
researchers' reflections on the open problems in the field. All in all, Cluj
was the place to be this July if interested in machine learning._

_Amidst all those captivating lectures spanned over six days one caught my eye
in particular: **Ulrich Paquet's** introduction to Variational Autoencoders.
Although I held some lectures on the topic myself in the past years, I found
Ulrich's [presentation](https://youtu.be/xTsnNcctvmU) remarkable for its
concise, visual, extremely clear, while at the same time strongly theoretical
elucidation of what and how VAEs do achieve. I wish my lectures were half as
good as his._

*Later that day, while visiting the boring salt mine near Turda, I also had the
chance to chat with Ulrich and ask him a few questions regarding generative
models, especially Boltzmann Machines. His exact words _Do not give up research
on Boltzmann Machines._ convinced me to recommence my efforts on training
different flavours of energy-based models to structure knowledge in
reinforcement learning setups.*


**Iulia Duță**:

_The main focus of the summer school was to popularize the machine learning
fields in Eastern Europe, so the lectures' content was a mixture of
introductory and more advanced topics. Knowing that beforehand, I arrived in
Cluj both with the goal of capturing speaker's intuitions on fundamental
concepts in machine learning and insights on open, more recent challenges in
the field._

_One of the lectures that I remarked as being well structured and
created exactly for this purpose was **Dumitru Erhan's** presentation: "Computer
Vision: Way  Beyond  Classification". He build the lecture incrementally, from
a classical computer vision problem (Object Detection) to a much hotter topic
[Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05424). Both of them were
presented in terms of how the field evolved over time, highlighting advantages
and disadvantages of each approaches. While the first part addresses a common
problem for computer vision researchers, Domain adaptation is a topic
extremely important for all machine learning subfields, being a worth studying
open problem. So besides useful knowledge and interactions, TMLSS showed us a
glimpse of novel research and a long bibliography to follow._


**Andrei Nicolicioiu**:

_The lecture that impressed me the most was the one about Graph Networks
presented by **Răzvan Pașcanu**. He showed intuitions about the priors existing
in deep networks and the need for models better suited for domains having
strong [relational priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261v2). We were
presented in a unified way different views of the domain from general graph
networks to simpler graph convolutional architectures, showing the usefulness
of relations both in problems involving data with a more obvious graph
structure as molecules and in unexpected places like the interactions of
memories in a recurrent model. The presentation certainly inspired me to study
more about these approaches and how can they be applied in my research._


**Dana Axinte**:

_Neural networks, gradients, posters, enthusiasm, magic. These are some of the
settings of the first Transylvanian Machine Learning Summer School held in
Cluj, Romania. Looking through the schedule and speakers, I expected the school
to be strong and that I would have the chance to settle new concepts while I
would engage with other participants with different backgrounds, but same
interests._

_I liked the balance between theoretically focused lectures and the ones that
presented the industry usage of those concepts. Such pair of lectures that I
particularly appreciated were the ones by **Doina Precup** who took a
progressive approach in presenting value-based methods with function
approximation for reinforcement learning and the one of **Raia Hadsell** who
showed how deep reinforcement learning can be applied into
[robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04286v2), with the challenges that exists
and the possible [solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00168v2)._

_One of the parts of the summer school that I especially enjoyed was the panel
session where some lecturers shared their opinion on different interesting
topics. The reproducibility of experiments, the future of AI research and
advices to increase the local AI ecosystems, as what could be the involvement
of governments, companies and teachers were few of the issues discussed. There
were no hype or buzzwords, but the lecturers were people who know today’s
limitations, needs and questions and get things done step by step, with an
engineering mindset. A fundamental feeling with which I left is that it is not
only about learning, but sharing the experience and knowledge gained to empower
others to create and to strengthen the community and motivation._


### Conclusions

It was only the first edition, but every detail was at a very high standard. In
the last days, we presented with Traian Rebedea the advantages of having the
next Summer School edition here in Bucharest. Looking forward to TMLSS2019 :)
