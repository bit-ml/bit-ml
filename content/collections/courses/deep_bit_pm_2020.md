The course is about basic Deep Learning methods, current models and
capabilities.

**Prerequisites**: Basic Python knowledge or several years as a programmer and
eagerness to start understanding Deep Learning.

## Lectures:

1. Introduction to Deep Learning
2. Neural Nets (Lab1 + Assignment1)
3. Optimization
4. Convolutional NNs(PROJECT proposals + Lab2 + Assignment2)
5. Computer Vision applications (choose PROJECT)
6. Recurrent NN (+ Lab3 + Assignment3)
7. Natural Language Processing applications
8. PROJECTs status (all mentors)
9. Final PROJECT presentations (all mentors)

## Labs and Assignments:

We use Pytorch for all coding materials.
3 labs (2h 30min each) + 3 Assignments (~2h each)
Lab1: PyTorch Intro (Assignment: Sudoku Solver)
Lab2: Convolutional NN (Assignment: Count digits in an image)
Lab3: Recurrent NN (Assignment: Given a code snippet, predict its programming language)

## Final Project:

Final Security related PROJECT which gave them the practical experience for apply deep learning in their next security project.
