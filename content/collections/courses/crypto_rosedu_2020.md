This course gives a brief introduction to lattices. We show how to use
lattice-based techniques to break a variety of public key systems, but also
how we may use them to design quantum-resistant solutions. The course is
organized by Bitdefender and ROSEdu.
**The first edition of the course is about to start in March. [Enroll

- **Prerequisites**: Basic Python (Sage), basic Linear Algebra concepts.
- **Course Team**: Mădălina Bolboceanu, Miruna Roșca, Radu Țițiu.

## Syllabus

1. Introduction: why should we care about lattice-based crypto?
2. Lattice algorithms used for cryptanalysis:
   - Finding short lattice vectors: LLL algorithm
   - Finding close lattice vectors: Babai nearest plane algorithm
3. Breaking public key encryption (ex: variants of RSA) using lattice algorithms
4. Breaking digital signatures (ex: DSA) using lattice algorithms
5. Build Post-Quantum crypto using lattices: (variants of) Learning With Errors
6. Compute on encrypted data using Learning With Errors:
   - Fully Homomorphic Encryption
   - Functional Encryption

## Practical sessions

The practical sessions consists in 3 labs and home assignments. There will be
special prizes based on the approaches for solving the assignments.

## Administrative details

- **When** and **Where**: Will be announced soon
