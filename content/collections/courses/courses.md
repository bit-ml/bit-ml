Here at **Bitdefender** we are actively involved in designing and teaching Deep
Learning and Cryptography courses in partnership with the top universities in Bucharest as
well as for our own internal use. Our purpuse is to bring students closer to the research field, with both practical and theoretical approaches, with lot of entuziasm and up to date content.

        <small> March - April </small>
        <p class="mo__body"> This course gives a brief introduction to lattices. We show how to use lattice-based techniques to break a variety of public key systems, but also how we may use them to design quantum-resistant solutions. This course is organized with ROSEdu's help. <b>Enrolments are open!</b>
