# DeepFMI 2020 <span>Learning Deep Neural Networks</span>

---

- **February 19th**: The course takes place in Stoilow lecture hall, every
Wednesday at 16:00 hours. The practicals (only for FMI students) will be
every other week, starting the first week, in room 308, from 18:00 hours
(right after the lecture).

- **February 7th**: The second edition of the course is
about to start (on February 19th). [Enroll

## About

The course is about basic Deep Learning methods, current models and
capabilities. It is an optional course primarily (but not exclusively) for
third-year undergraduates of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science,
University of Bucharest. It covers basic theoretical concepts about training
neural networks, followed by applications in computer vision and natural
language understanding, with an accent on the applied part, through labs,
assignments and the final project.

- **Prerequisites**: Basic Python knowledge or several years as a programmer and
eagerness to start understanding Deep Learning.
- **Course Team**: Emanuela Haller, Florin Gogianu, Andrei Nicolicioiu, Iulia Duta, Florin Brad, Elena Burceanu, Andrei Manolache, Covaci Adrian

## Syllabus

1. Introduction to Deep Learning
   - **Lab1: Intro to Python, PyTorch and Tensors**
2. Neural Nets
3. Optimization
   - **Lab2: Training and Optimization**
   - **Assignment1**
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Computer Vision applications
   - **Lab3: CNN on images**
   - **Assignment2: Count digits in an image**
6. Recurrent NN
7. Natural Language Processing applications
   - **Lab4: RNNs on language**
8. Unsupervised Learning Models
9. PROJECT Status
   - **Lab5: Verify Assignments**
10. Poster Session with the PROJECTs

Based on the last year course experience, this second edition will focus less
on evaluating the theoretical aspects and will have less payload for the end
of the semester. From the lecture content point of view, we will
replace the Reinforcement Learning lectures with lectures on Unsupervised
Learning.

## Practical sessions

We use [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/) for all coding materials and we work in the
[**Colab Notebooks**](https://colab.research.google.com) environment. There is a total of five Labs, two Home Assignments and one final PROJECT, presented in the Poster Session (see below the ones from the **Previous Edition**).

## Administrative details

- **When**: February 19th - April 22nd 2020, on Wednesday evening
