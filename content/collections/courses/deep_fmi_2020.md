The course is about basic Deep Learning methods, current models and capabilities. It is an optional course primarily (but not exclusively) for third-year undergraduates of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. It covers basic theoretical concepts about training neural networks, followed by applications in computer vision and natural language understanding, with an accent on the applied part, through labs, assignments and the final project.

## The second edition of the course is about to start (on February 19th). [**Enroll now!**]((https://forms.gle/pFSUmhcpJktkuWuMA))

**Prerequisites**: Basic Python knowledge or several years as a programmer and
eagerness to start understanding Deep Learning.

**Course Team**: Emanuela Haller, Florin Gogianu, Andrei Nicolicioiu, Iulia Duta, Florin Brad, Elena Burceanu, Andrei Manolache

## Content (by week)

1. Introduction to Deep Learning
2. Neural Nets (+ Lab1 + Assignment1)
3. Optimization
4. Convolutional Neural Networks (+ PROJECT proposals + Lab2 + Assignment2)
5. Computer Vision applications (+ choose PROJECT)
6. Recurrent NN (+ Lab3 + Assignment3)
7. Natural Language Processing applications
8. Unsupervised Learning Models (+ Lab4: PROJECTs status)
9. Unsupervised Learning Models
10. PROJECTs poster presentation

Based on the last year course experience, the second edition will focus less on evaluating the theoretical aspects. We will also add slides notes on every lecture and we will provide a support book. From the lecture content point of view, we will replace Reinforcement Learning lectures with lectures on Unsupervised Learning.

## Practical sessions

We use [**Pytorch**](https://pytorch.org/) for all coding materials and [**Colab Notebooks**](colab.research.google.com) for the environment. There is a total of 3 Labs, 3 Home Assignments and one final PROJECT:
1. PyTorch Intro (Home: TODO)
2. Convolutional NN (Home: Count digits in an image)
3. Recurrent NN (Home: Predict the programming language of a code snippet)
4. PROJECTs status
5. PROJECTs presentation (Poster Session)
