# DeepFMI 2020 <span>Learning Deep Neural Networks</span>

The course is about basic Deep Learning methods, current models and
capabilities. It is an optional course primarily (but not exclusively) for
third-year undergraduates of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science,
University of Bucharest. It covers basic theoretical concepts about training
neural networks, followed by applications in computer vision and natural
language understanding, with an accent on the applied part, through labs,
assignments and the final project. **The second edition of the course is about to start (on February 19th).
[Enroll now!](https://forms.gle/pFSUmhcpJktkuWuMA)**

- **Prerequisites**: Basic Python knowledge or several years as a programmer and
eagerness to start understanding Deep Learning.
- **Course Team**: Emanuela Haller, Florin Gogianu, Andrei Nicolicioiu, Iulia
Duta, Florin Brad, Elena Burceanu, Andrei Manolache

## Syllabus

1. Introduction to Deep Learning
   - Lab1: Intro
2. Neural Nets
3. Optimization
   - Lab2: Training and Optimization + Assignment
4. Convolutional Neural Networks (PROJECT proposals)
5. Computer Vision applications
   - Lab3: CNN on Images + Assignment
6. Recurrent NN (choose PROJECT)
7. Natural Language Processing applications
   - Lab4: RNN on Language
8. Unsupervised Learning Models
9. PROJECT Status
   - Lab5: Verify Assignments
10. PROJECT poster presentation

Based on the last year course experience, the second edition will focus less
on evaluating the theoretical aspects and will have less payload for the end
of the semester. We will also add slide notes on every lecture and we will
provide a support book. From the lecture content point of view, we will
replace the Reinforcement Learning lectures with lectures on Unsupervised
Learning.

## Practical sessions

We use [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/) for all coding materials and
[**Colab Notebooks**](colab.research.google.com) for the environment. There
is a total of 5 Labs, 2 Home Assignments and one final PROJECT:

1. Intro to Python, PyTorch and Tensors
2. Training and Optimization (Home: TODO)
3. Convolutional NN (Home: Count digits in an image)
4. Recurrent NN
5. Verify Assignments
Poster Session with the Final PROJECT.
