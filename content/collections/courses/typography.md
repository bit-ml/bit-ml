# H1 Titles are hard to find

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
readable content of a page when looking at its layout. **The point** of using
Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
English.

## H2 Even if you search deeply

Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many
web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
like).

<div class="mo">
  <a href="/teaching/deep-fmi-2020/" class="mo__link">
    <img class="mo__img" src="/galleries/courses/thumb_unibuc.jpg" alt="">
    <header class="mo__header">
      <h4 class="mo__title">DeepFMI - Learning Deep Neural Networks |
      upcoming</h4>
      <small> February  - April </small>
    </header>
    <p class="mo__body"> The course is about basic Deep Learning methods, current models and capabilities. It covers basic theoretical concepts about training neural networks, followed by applications in computer vision and natural language understanding, with an accent on the applied part, through labs, assignments and the final project. <b>Enrollments are open!</b>
    </p>

### H3 Some never show up

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
2000 years old.

#### H4 Testimonials

This is how citing someone on this site should look like.

<blockquote>
EEML also provided me with the opportunity of presenting my work on
Bayesian-inspired prioritization measures for the Experience Replay buffer
during one of the two poster sessions. It was actually my first
conference-like poster session I attended so it was a rather interesting
experience. I received some great suggestions from Diana Borsa which might
help me polish this research further and also got some follow-up questions
from the people I met there. Somehow I also got one of the Best Poster Awards
and that wrapped-up nicely the great experience I had attending EEML.
