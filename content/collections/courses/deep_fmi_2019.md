# DeepFMI 2019 <span>Learning Deep Neural Networks</span>


The course is about basic Deep Learning methods, current models and capabilities. It is an optional course for third-year undergraduates of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. It covers basic theoretical concepts about training neural networks, followed by applications in computer vision and natural language understanding, with an accent on the applied part, through labs, home assignments and the final project.

- **Prerequisites**: Basic Python knowledge or several years as a programmer and
eagerness to start understanding Deep Learning.
- **Course Team**: Stefan Postavaru, Andrei Nicolicioiu, Iulia Duta, Florin Brad, Tudor Berariu, Elena Burceanu

10. **Poster Session** with the PROJECTs
    - Exam

## Practical sessions
We use [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/) for all coding materials and we work in the
[**Colab Notebooks**](https://colab.research.google.com) environment. There is a total of four Labs, four Home Assignments and one final PROJECT - see **Poster Session** below.


## Administrative details

- **When**: February - April 2019, on Wednesday evening
- **Where**: Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest
- **Google Group**: [deeplearning_fmi_year3](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/deeplearning_fmi_year3)
- [**Course Materials**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17s9wLVa7rn9hrYkdJSJhVCtoOGHBd1aW)

## Poster Session

Working on the final PROJECT gave students the practical experience for applying deep learning in their next deep learning project. You can find bellow the final posters:
