        "description": "We address an essential problem in computer vision, that of unsupervised foreground object segmentation in video, where a main object of interest in a video sequence should be automatically separated from its background. Video object segmentation and object discovery are strongly related tasks, but we tackle the problem from a fully unsupervised perspective, building object representations from raw video sequences. An efficient solution to this task would enable large-scale video interpretation at a high semantic level in the absence of the costly manual labeling.\nWe are focused on generating foreground object soft masks based on automatic selection and learning from highly probable positive features. We show that such features can be selected efficiently by taking into consideration the spatio-temporal appearance and motion consistency of the object in the video sequence. We also emphasize the role of the contrasting properties between the foreground object and its background. Our work is also focused on theoretically proving the properties of our unsupervised learning method, which under some mild constraints is guaranteed to learn the correct classifier even in the unsupervised case.",

An adaptive selection mechanism finds consensus among multiple paths reaching a given node and establishes the pseudo-ground truth at that node. Such pseudo-labels, given by ensemble pathways in the graph, are used during the next learning iteration when single edges distill this distributed knowledge.",

Our goal is to detect objects and events in a video and be capable of understanding the interactions between them in spatial and temporal dimensions.\nWe investigated multiple methods to analyze a video and extract information from it. To overcome limitations of the task and the available data, we design multiple models, to explore different video encoding strategies, to explore intermediate video-language representation and to investigate the gains brought by additional tasks and features. We propose a method for video captioning by selecting from the results of multiple encoder-decoder models. Our selection method based on consensus among multiple sentences is more likely to produce results with the same meaning as the video.

While it has attracted the interest of many researchers over several decades of computer vision, it is far from being solved.\nThe task is hard for many reasons. Difficulties could come from severe changes in object appearance, presence of background clutter and occlusions that might take place in the video.\nThe only ground-truth knowledge given to the tracker is the bounding box of the object in the first frame. Thus, without knowing in advance the properties of the object being tracked, the tracking algorithm must learn them on the fly. It must adapt correctly and make sure it does not jump toward other objects in the background. That is why the possibility of drifting to the background poses on of the main challenges in tracking.",
