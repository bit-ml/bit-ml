        "description": "Object tracking is one of the first and most fundamental problems that has been addressed in computer vision. While it has attracted the interest of many researchers over several decades of computer vision, it is far from being solved.\nThe task is hard for many reasons. Difficulties could come from severe changes in object appearance, presence of background clutter and occlusions that might take place in the video.\nThe only ground-truth knowledge given to the tracker is the bounding box of the object in the first frame. Thus, without knowing in advance the properties of the object being tracked, the tracking algorithm must learn them on the fly. It must adapt correctly and make sure it does not jump toward other objects in the background. That is why the possibility of drifting to the background poses on of the main challenges in tracking.",

        "description": "Video captioning is the task of describing a video in natural language. It lies at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning requiring both high level visual comprehension and the ability to produce meaningful sentences. Our goal is to detect objects and events in a video and be capable of understanding the interactions between them in spatial and temporal dimensions.\nWe investigated multiple methods to analyze a video and extract information from it. To overcome limitations of the task and the available data, we design multiple models, to explore different video encoding strategies, to explore intermediate video-language representation and to investigate the gains brought by additional tasks and features. We propose a method for video captioning by selecting from the results of multiple encoder-decoder models. Our selection method based on consensus among multiple sentences is more likely to produce results with the same meaning as the video. We designed a methods that surpassed the state-of-the-art results on the challenging MSR-VTT dataset.",

        "description": "We address an essential problem in computer vision, that of unsupervised foreground object segmentation in video, where a main object of interest in a video sequence should be automatically separated from its background. Video object segmentation and object discovery are strongly related tasks, but we tackle the problem from a fully unsupervised perspective, building object representations from raw video sequences. An efficient solution to this task would enable large-scale video interpretation at a high semantic level in the absence of the costly manual labeling.\nWe are focused on generating foreground object soft masks based on automatic selection and learning from highly probable positive features. We show that such features can be selected efficiently by taking into consideration the spatio-temporal appearance and motion consistency of the object in the video sequence. We also emphasize the role of the contrasting properties between the foreground object and its background. Our work is also focused on theoretically proving the properties of our unsupervised learning method, which under some mild constraints is guaranteed to learn the correct classifier even in the unsupervised case.",

Also, situated environments ask agents to learn dynamic strategies capable of dealing with sudden changes in the course of action (such as another playing abandoning the collaborative strategy).\nWe approached the contest by training agents through deep reinforcement learning techniques using recurrent neural networks for policies and for value estimation. We also added auxiliary loss functions (such as next reward, or next frame prediction) in order to complement the sparse reward signal.\n Our submission ranked second for the AI Summer School placement prize and third for the Microsoft Azure for Research Grant prize.",
